# GameProjectTLoV
A long term game project made with GameMaker.

BACKGROUND:
This game is a short retro-inspired 2D-platformer which I started working on when I still was very new to software development. I had just taken an interest in coding and since I always have had a big passion for video games I thought a good place to start could be to try to make a small game of my own. I started out watching Sara Spalding's Youtube tutorials with the goal to create a very simplistic game but as I started my computer engineering education and my programming skills improved the project quickly grew in scope. In parallel with making this game I ran a Dungeons and Dragons campaign for a group of friends which inspired me to make the game about their characters and based on some of their adventures.

It has been a long and educational process of making this game while also studying and working. Even though I have a lot of self critiscism and thoughts about what I should have made differently I am very proud to have finished it and am eager to start my next project. If anyone decides to play the game and gets some kind of enjoyment from playing, it would make me very happy.

HOW TO PLAY:
The game is played using a keyboard or an Xbox controller. I recommend using a controller but keybindings can be changed if you are using a keyboard. If there is any problem with the resolution when starting the game I would recommend trying to toggle Fullscreen mode on and off using the F5 key.

The game can be run in three different ways where alternative 1 and 2 should work for systems running Windows 10/11:

1. Download the installer from the Executables folder. Run the installer and install the game with your preferences.

2. Download "TheLegendOfVigil.zip" from the Executables folder. Extract the folder and run the .exe file "TheLegendOfVigil.exe".

3. Download all the contents of the folder "TheLegendOfVigil" and open the project-file "TheLegendOfVigil.yyp" in GameMaker. From there you should be able to run the game in addition to view and edit all the code and assets. This game was developed using GameMaker studio 2 (Runtime 2024.4.0.168) but any future version of GameMaker should hopefully work as well.
